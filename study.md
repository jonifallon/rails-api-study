# Rails as an API Study

Use your favorite search engine and the provided readings to research and
respond to the following questions.

In your responses, be sure to cite any relevant sources you consulted in your
search. We ask you to write responses in your own words in order to see how you
process what you've read. Please do not respond with direct quotes from source
material. Instead, digest what you've read and repeat it in your own voice.

Please note:

-   Many of the readings will mention the "view" layer. We won't be covering the
    view layer in this program.
-   We'll use our [Rails API Template](https://github.com/ga-wdi-boston/rails-api-template)
    repository as the basis for our rails applications.
    This template excludes the "view" layer.

## Define Model Responsibilities

In your own words, define what the responsibilities of the model layer are in
Rails.

```md
The model layer is responsible for storing and validating data and retrieving data form the database.  They also perform the business logic.  Models are Ruby classes.
```

## Define Controller Responsibilities

In your own words, define what the responsibilities of the controller layer are
in Rails.

```md
The controllers take info passed from the browser and decide what to do with it.  They can parse requests, data, cookies and sessions.  It communicates with the model layer to retrieve what the user is requesting.
```

## Define Router Responsibilities

In your own words, define what the router does in Rails.

```md
The Rails router recognizes URLs and dispatches them to a controller's action. It can also generate paths and URLs.  It interprets GET, POST, PATCH/PUT and DELETE to dispatch appropriately.

```

## The Request-Response Cycle in Rails

Starting with a client making a GET request to a particular URL, describe how
the parts of Rails interact to produce and send a response.

```md

request comes from the browser.
The router tells Rails to send the request to DocumentsController and invoke the show action.
The controller then decides what to show to the user
The model will retrieve appropriate data from the db.
Rails sends it back through the middleware to the browser.
